## Overview

![screenshot](screenshot/127.0.0.1_5500_index.html_.png)

**Device Shop Checkout** is a clean and responsive checkout page designed to display selected products, total prices, and a user information form in one elegant layout.  
The layout is built using a combination of **CSS Grid** and **Flexbox**, while the color scheme is managed through **CSS custom properties (variables)** for better theme control.

This project was created as a submission to a [devChallenges.io](https://devchallenges.io/challenge/apple-shop-checkout-page-challenge) challenge.
